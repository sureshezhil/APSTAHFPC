Installation
============

If you have already downloaded pushnotify, run the following
command inside this directory::

    $ python setup.py install

If you have not yet downloaded pushnotify, it would be easier to do
the following::

    $ pip install pushnotify

Either method will install pushnotify into your current environment.
