Development
===========

All development for pushnotify takes place on bitbucket:

* https://bitbucket.org/jgoettsch/py-pushnotify/

You can follow this project on Twitter:

* https://twitter.com/pypushnotify

To get started you can do the following::

    $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/jgoettsch/py-pushnotify/
    $ cd py-pushnotify
    $ pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
    $ python setup.py develop

If you discover a bug, please create an issue ticket:

* https://bitbucket.org/jgoettsch/py-pushnotify/issues/new

To run the test suite, you will have to create three modules:

* pushnotify/tests/nmakeys.py:

    This file must contain two global variables: API_KEYS and
    DEVELOPER_KEY. API_KEYS is a list containing at least one valid API
    key as a string. DEVELOPER_KEY is a string containing a valid
    developer key.
    
* pushnotify/tests/prowlkeys.py:

    This file must contain two global variables: API_KEYS and
    PROVIDER_KEY. API_KEYS is a list containing at least one valid API
    key as a string. PROVIDER_KEY is a string containing a valid
    provider key. REG_TOKEN is a valid registration token that has
    already been validated through the retrieve_token/retrieve_apikey
    process.

* pushnotify/tests/pushoverkeys.py:

    This file must contain two global variables: TOKEN and USER.
    TOKEN is a string containing a valid API token. USER is a
    dictionary whose keys are strings containing valid user identifiers.
    The key values are lists containing strings, where each string
    contains a valid device identifier for the given API token. There
    must be one API token, and it must have one device identifier.
